The making of this application involves understanding in nodeJS, npm, GET and POST AJAX calls, and routes. It requires 2 different packages: body-parser and express. This application works by a user inputting their scores for each of the 10 questions and comparing it to an array of other objects/previous user inputs to find the least score difference and bringing up a modal of the closest match. Furthermore, it POSTS the user input into the array and stores it for future uses/users.
